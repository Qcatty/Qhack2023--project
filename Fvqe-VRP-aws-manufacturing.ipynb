    "The aim of this notebook is to implement the Filtering VQE algorithm for solving the VRP. We will not here explain all the algorithm, so just refer to [the original article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10055) to understand it properly. Essentially, a regular VQE would use the expectation value of a hamiltonian $H$ on a quantum parametriced circuit in order to try and minimize that expectation value. What the Filtering VQE will do is use that parametriced circuit in order to approximate the action of some operator $F_\\tau = f(H, \\tau)$ that effectively projects a given wavefunction into lower energy eigenstates, thus, filtering the higher energy eigenstates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will not cover how the VRP is formulated and solved in detail, since that is already exposed on [the Qiskit tutorial on the VRP](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/optimization/7_examples_vehicle_routing.html). However, we add an little summary of the used notation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial problem, wherein the best routes from a depot to a number of clients and back to the depot are sought, given a number of available vehicles. There are a number of formulations possible, extending a number of formulations of the traveling salesman problem [Applegate et al, 2006]. Here, we present a formulation known as MTZ [Miller, Tucker, Zemlin, 1960]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ be the number of clients (indexed as $1,\\dots,n$), and $K$ be the number of available vehicles. Let $x_{ij} = \\{0,1\\}$ be the binary decision variable which, if it is $1$, activates the segment from node $i$ to node $j$. The node index runs from $0$ to $n$, where $0$ is (by convention) the depot. There are twice as many distinct decision variables as edges. For example, in a fully connected graph, there are $n(n+1)$ binary decision variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "If two nodes $i$ and $j$ have a link from $i$ to $j$, we write $i \\sim j$. We also denote with $\\delta(i)^+$ the set of nodes to which $i$ has a link, i.e., $j \\in \\delta(i)^+$ if and only if $i \\sim j$. Similarly, we denote with \n",
    "$\\delta(i)^-$ the set of nodes which are connected to $i$, in the sense that $j \\in \\delta(i)^-$ if and only if $j \\sim i$. \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, there will be a variable $x_{ij}$ that will tell if there is a vehicle going from node $i$ to node $j$. Our way to obtain a solution is to consider a vector ${\\bf z}$ containing all that information\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\bf z} = [x_{01},x_{02},\\ldots,x_{10}, x_{12},\\ldots,x_{n(n-1)}]^T,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and, as $x_{ij}$ is a binary variable, that vector can be identified as a bitstring. This is why it makes sense to try and map the problem into a QUBO and then into an Ising Hamiltonian (it's diagonal); our solution can be depicted as one of the eigenstates that will, in fact, be one of the computational basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a very simple exercise, imagine that we are given the solution\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\bf z} = [x_{01},x_{10}]^T = [1,1]^T,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus, $x_{01}=1$ means that there is a vehicle going from the depot to node $1$ and $x_{10}=1$ means that there is a vehicle going from node $1$ to the depot. There are no more variables and that means that there is only $K=1$ vehicle visiting a single depot. Quite a trivial example."
