# Qhack2023--project

In this repository we set out to calculate the the ground state energy of the molecule as accurately using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, [TETRIS Adaptive VQE for BeH2](https://github.com/Qcatty/Qhack2023--project/blob/main/TETRIS_Adaptive_VQE_for_BeH2.ipynb) for #quantum chemistry challenge, #Quantum computing today challenge, and #Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing Challenge, also we used two error mitigation technique (NI+TFLO) to our VQE to accelerated.  [this file :https://github.com/Qcatty/Qhack2023--project/blob/main/FVQE%20to%20B2H2-error%20mitigation.ipynb]

for the #manufacturing challenge, we tried to solve the vehicule routing problem using the F-VQE, we haven't had enough time to apply the error mitigation technique (NI+TFLO) to our F-VQE, but we will work on that later![https://github.com/Qcatty/Qhack2023--project/blob/main/Fvqe-VRP-aws-manufacturing.ipynb]

our work is base on these papers:
